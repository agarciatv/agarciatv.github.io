Installing exFAT read and write abilities on Linux is easy! This works on Ubuntu 14.04, Lubuntu 14.10 and Linux Mint 17.1.

To begin you'll need to open Terminal and type in the following command:

<strong>sudo apt-get install exfat-fuse exfat-utils</strong>

Then press enter.

The terminal will then scroll through a lot of text and will ask if you want to install this package. Type y and press enter.

You should now be able to read and write on exFAT formatted drives.
