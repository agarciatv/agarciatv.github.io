In an age of specialization, the word Polymath isn’t a term that is used in everyday conversation. A temptation may arise to select the word and look it up in your iPhone’s dictionary. 

According to Apple’s dictionary a polymath is “a person of wide-ranging knowledge or learning.” The origin is from the early 17th century (also known as the Renaissance): from Greek polumathēs ‘having learned much,’ from polu- ‘much’ + the stem of manthanein ‘learn.’

Today, stumbling upon a polymath is exceptionally rare as we are conditioned to focus on one discipline of learning. Motivated by what makes good business sense rather than what stimulates the mind, we specialize. 

A few of us, however, make our home on the borders of many disciplines. Driven by a desire to learn, dream, invent and share. Our eyes grow wide with amazement and our hearts race with excitement at the discovery of something new. We enjoy learning as much as a culinary connoisseur enjoys exquisite delicacies. 

This puts modern polymaths in a predicament – instead of being valued as people of great learning they are discarded, because they do not fit into the business machine. The business world of today values specialization and sees the interest in many subjects as “a Jack of all trades, master of none.”

It is to be noted that not all businesses operate this way, but many do. And for someone who does not fit into a box or is even aware that a box exists – it has been a long journey to discover what exactly it is I do. I do not do just one thing, I do not just play one instrument – I play the orchestra.

In the digital age, more people who love learning digital pursuits will find themselves on the verge of becoming polymaths; unable to decide which field they truly belong in. I found myself interested in app development, graphic design, video production, web development, business and marketing. In theory I could do it all, though that would prove exhausting. This explains the rise of startups, a handful of extraordinary talented individuals throwing all they have into creating something outstanding.

Don’t feel out of place, know that you are truly special. Make things, take risks and be awesome!
